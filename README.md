# Portfolio Project

Purpose:
* This is my portfolio space to demonstrate my skills, and experience within the spaces of Data Engineering and Data Analysis. This portfolio project will focus on data from a popular North American Sport, baseball, with the statistics focusing on the Major League Baseball League 2022 season.

==================================================================================
==================================================================================
==================================================================================

Topics I want to demonstrate:
* Extract, Transfer, Loading (ETL)
* Data Cleansing
* Data Modelling
* Data Visualization
* Data Quality Validation
* Data Quality Testing

==================================================================================
==================================================================================
==================================================================================

Target use of the following toolsets:
* Data Quality Testing & Functional Testing
    * DBT Project 
        * I will not be able to proceed to implement this portfolio as a DBT project. This is due to cost of Snowflake, inability to use a student based option for longer than 1 month.
    * Unit Testing - Python unittest Library
        * I will be writing unittests to validate that the transformed data at different stages of the project aligns with known conditions, and the expected outputs of certain functions.
* SQL
    * Currently, I will be using SQLite3 in order to display my abilities writing queries for this project.
* Python
    * Libraries in use:
        * Pandas
        * Unittest
        * Numpy
        * OS
        * Pathlib
* Docker
    * Implemented Airflow through use of Docker Desktop. 
* Airflow 
    * As of 2023/12/13 - I have moved the project to use Airflow, which I have running using a Docker Container. I will be expanding the structuring of my current DAGs over time to continue to display my skills in this area.
* GIT
    * I will be using this GitHub repo, and will be using my background with GIT to display my understanding.
* Dashboarding Tool - Power BI
    * Reporting File --> See presentation files directory
    * UI UX developed using Figma 
* Github CI/CD
    * ACTION - TBD
* Postman / Use of APIs
    * ACTION - TBD
* Python Data Visualization 
    * ACTION - matplotlib
    * ACTION - Seaborn
