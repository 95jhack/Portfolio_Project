# JHack_Portfolio

Purpose:
* This is my portfolio space to demonstrate my skills, and experience within the spaces of Data Engineering and Data Analysis. This portfolio project will focus on data from a popular North American Sport, baseball focusing on the Major League Baseball League.

==================================================================================
==================================================================================
==================================================================================

Topics I want to demonstrate:
* Extract, Transfer, Loading (ETL)
* Data Cleansing

==================================================================================

Target use of the following toolsets:
* Data Quality Testing
    * DBT Project 
        * I will not be able to proceed to implement this portfolio as a DBT project. This is due to cost of Snowflake, inability to use a student based option.
    * Unit Testing - Python unittest Library
        * I will be writing unittests to validate that the transformed data at different stages of the project aligns with known conditions, and the expected outputs of certain functions.
* SQL
    * Currently, I will be using SQLite3 in order to display my abilities writing queries for this project.
* Python
    * Libraries in use:
        * Pandas
        * Unittest
        * ACTION - TBD
* GIT
    * I will be using this GitHub repo, and will be using my background with GIT to display my understanding. 
* Github CI/CD?
    * ACTION - TBD
* Postman / Use of APIs
