# JHack_Portfolio

This space is my portfolio space to demonstrate my skills, and experience within the spaces of Data Engineering and Data Analysis.

Concept Ideas: 
Pull data from numerous different sources for a sport. Ex: Baseball, Soccer, Hockey

Topics I want to demonstrate:
* Extract, Transfer, Loading (ETL)
* Data Cleansing
* Data Modelling
* Data Visualization
* Data Quality Validation
* Data Quality Testing

Target use of the following toolsets:
* DBT Project - use of seed files, potentially using other external data sources to demonstrate a variety
* SQL
* Python
* GIT
* Github CI/CD?
* Postman / Use of APIs
* Power BI / Visualization in Python (matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Figma ---> Develop a UI/UX
* Docker?? Perhaps to Spin up an Airflow project, different DAG configurations

Dimensions:
* Individual player stats
* Team Stats
* Dates
  
Facts:
* Game by Game Stats - Player
* Game by Game Stats - Team

2022 Data from Major League Baseball - Game by Game Logs
2022 Team Standings 
2022 Team Batting Stats 
2022 Team Pitching Stats
2022 Player Summarized Stats

Potential tests to run
* Team Wins vs. Team Wins seen in the game by game
* Player Stats (Hits, HRs) vs. Summarized stats in game by game
